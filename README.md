# Telecom Churn Dataset: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a telecom customer churn dataset using Python and Power BI. The aim is to preprocess the data effectively and prepare it for machine learning tasks like churn prediction, while also deriving actionable insights through visualizations.

## Key Features
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Removed unnecessary columns (e.g., `Customer ID`).
  - Handled missing and incorrect data.
  - Ensured the dataset was clean and ready for analysis and modeling.
- **Data Export**:
  - Saved the cleaned dataset into a new CSV file for further use.
- **Visualization**:
  - Leveraged Power BI to create visualizations and uncover important insights about customer churn.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Data preprocessing and analysis
  - Libraries: `Pandas`, `NumPy`
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and insights generation

## Dataset Details
- **Source**: Telecom customer churn dataset.
- **Target Variable**: Churn (indicates whether a customer left the service or not).
- **Features**: Customer demographics, account information, service details, etc.

## Workflow
1. **Data Loading**:
   - Imported the dataset using Python.
   - Conducted initial data inspection to understand the structure and quality of the data.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Dropped irrelevant columns like `Customer ID`.
   - Handled missing values using appropriate imputation techniques.
   - Corrected any inconsistent or erroneous data.

3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Standardized column names.
   - Checked and ensured data types were consistent for analysis.

4. **Data Export**:
   - Saved the preprocessed dataset into a new CSV file for seamless integration with machine learning models.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Used Power BI to create dashboards and visualizations, highlighting key trends and patterns in the data.

## Results and Insights
- Identified key factors contributing to customer churn.
- Created actionable visual insights to support strategic decision-making.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telecom-churn-eda.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy
   ```

3. Load the cleaned CSV file into Power BI for visualization.
   ```
   
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effective use of Python for data preprocessing and Power BI for visualization, enabling a better understanding of telecom customer churn and preparing the data for predictive modeling.
